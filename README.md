# Fundamentals of Programming Practical: 

# C & Python

## Project Overview:

I'll be sharing insights and experiences from a course I completed at school - "Fundamentals of Programming Practical: C & Python.

In the upcoming posts, I'll be attaching lecture slides, my coding projects, intricate flowcharts, and insightful pseudocode examples that were part of my practice exercises. We'll explore the essential concepts and principles of programming, unraveling the magic behind two powerful and versatile languages: C and Python.
